# Richard (RJ) Gary

## Thank you for visiting my GitHub Page!

Welcome! I'm assuming you came here either from my LinkedIn or my business card. For the time being, this will mainly be an additional venue to showcase my resume (both in French and English). That is because this site is a project I undertook with the goal of increasing my familiarity with GitHub, and I wanted to create something useful to me as a learning tool.

As the site description mentions, I am a recent graduate of the University of Georgia. Specifically, I received my B.B.A. in Finance and International Business from the Terry College of Business. In addition, I minored in French and Music, and received a Certificate in Legal Studies.

My goal is to attain a full-time role in investment banking/capital markets, asset management, or consulting. By creating this website, I'm hoping to demonstrate my ability to learn quickly and my willingness to branch out. Though it likely won't be the most elaborate website, I am confident that it will convey the fact that I am a diligent self-starter capable of working independtly in any full-time role.

Thank you for taking the time to read and explore my site, and I hope you'll contact me if you're interested in speaking with (or hiring) me!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
